    "\n",
    "Usually we use `np.arange` to return an array that steps from `a` to `b` with a fixed step size `s`. While this is fine in some cases, we sometimes prefer to use `np.linspace(a, b, N)`, which divides the interval `[a, b]` into N equally spaced points.\n",
    "\n",
    "`np.arange(start, stop, step)` produces an array with all the numbers starting at `start`, incremendted up by `step`, stopping **before** `stop` is reached. For example, the value of `np.arange(1, 6, 2)` is an array with elements 1, 3, and 5 -- it starts at 1 and counts up by 2, then stops before 6. `np.arange(4, 9, 1)` is an array with elements 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. (It doesn't contain 9 because `np.arange` stops _before_ the stop value is reached.)\n",
    "\n",
    " `np.linspace` always includes **both end points** while `np.arange` will **not** include the second end point `b`. For this reason, especially when we are plotting ranges of values we tend to prefer `np.linspace`.\n",
