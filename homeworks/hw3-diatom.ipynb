    "## Background: diatoms and paleoclimatology\n",
    "\n",
    "Diatoms are a type of phytoplankton -- they are photosynthetic algae that function as primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. Diatoms are at the bottom of the food web: they are consumed by filter feeders, like clams, mussels, and many fish, which are in turn consumed by larger organisms like scavengers and predators and, well, us. As a result, changes in the composition of diatom species in marine ecosystems have ripple effects that can dramatically alter overall community structure in any environment of which marine life forms a part. \n",
    "\n",
    "Diatoms have glass bodies. As a group of organisms, they display a great diversity of body shapes, and many are quite elaborate. The image below, taken from a Scientific American article, shows a small sample of their shapes and structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src='figures/diatoms-sciam.jpg' style='width:400px'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they are made of glass, diatoms preserve extraordinarily well over time. When they die, their bodies sink and form part of the sediment. Due to their abundance, there is a sort of steady rain of diatoms forming part of the sedimentation process, which produces sediment layers that are dense with diatoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sedimentation is a long-term process spanning great stretches of time, and the deeper one looks in sediment, the older the material. Since diatoms are present in high density throughout sedimentation layers, and they preserve so well, it is possible to study their presence over immense time spans -- potentially hundreds of thousands of years. \n",
    "\n",
    "A branch of paleoclimatology is dedicated to studying changes in biological productivity on geologic time scales, and much research in this area has involved studying the relative abundances of diatoms. In this assignment, you'll do just that on a small scale and work with data from sediment cores taken in the gulf of California at the location indicated on the map:\n",

    "The data are diatom counts sampled from evenly-spaced depths in a sediment core from the gulf of California. In sediment cores, depth correlates with time before the present -- deeper layers are older -- and depths are typically chosen to obtain a desired temporal resolution. The counts were recorded by sampling material from sediment cores at each depth, and examining the sampled material for phytoplankton cells. For each sample, phytoplankton were identified at the taxon level and counts of diatom taxa were recorded along with the total number of phytoplankton cells identified. Thus:\n",

This is a common phenomenon in ecological data, and even has a name: it results in a 'zero inflated' distribution of values. The statistician to identify and name the phenomenon was Diane Lambert, whose highly influential work on the subject (>4k citations) was published in 1992.\n",

You may have noticed, for example, that there was no bandwidth parameter for the KDE curve that *both* captured the shape of the histogram near zero *and* away from zero -- it either got the height near zero right but was too wiggly, or got the shape away from zero right but was too low near zero."

This is because the colors in the heat map in the row/column for A_nodul are blue except for itself and CoscinSpp where it is close to white. By just visualizing it, this means that the abundance of Azpeitia nodulife means very little presence of the other taxa and vice versa.*"

    "*When age is older than 11,000 years, the community composition of diatom taxa has a positive and smaller estimated density of PC1 compared to when age is younger than 11,000 years. On the other hand, when age is older than 11,000 years, PC2 has slightly negative value and a high estimated density while PC1 is around the value 0 and has a lower estimated density. Regarding the variation of PC1, in the years between 11,000-14,000 years ago, the spread is much larger than more recent years when the spread is much smaller. As for the variation of PC2, the spread for more recent years is larger than the spread of PC1 from 11,000 to 14,000 years ago.*"

We think it would interesting to explore the relationship between depth and the abundance of the diatoms as well as with time. It is possible that some of the species are more abundant at certain depths than others. The question we want to pose for further exploration is how abundant are these diatoms at different depths and how does abundance vary across depth levels?*"
