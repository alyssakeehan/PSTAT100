    "\n",
    "Unjust police shootings have sparked national outrage in the United States and have started international social movements, such as Black Lives Matter that protest against incidents of racially motivated police violence. The media spotlight has been shined on numerous infamous cases of potentially prejudiced police shooting victims, like the shooting of Breonna Taylor. Our project aims to explore whether police shootings are racially biased and if certain racial groups are targeted more. We also aim to look specifically at California which is the State that has the most police shootings and to see if there are any racial disparities in its victims. We find that there is a difference between the  racial distribution of police shooting victims and the racial distribution of the population and that African Americans are overly represented in the population of police shooting victims. We determine that our county demographic data on education and income have no correlated variables with  black shooting victim population and that California reflects our previous findings and also that Hispanics are overly represented in the State’s population of police shooting victims as well.\n"

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequent and lawful police killings in just the last year have contributed to some of the hardest months of the pandemic. With the media coverage of the Black Lives Matter Movements, it seems that so many Police Shooting Victims are African American. However, we noticed that in total there are more White victims than Black in police killings. The connection between police killings and race, especially, has become an even larger issue and has led to mass protesting and looting all over the country. In light of these events circling the wrongful police killings, we intend to create an educational, meaningful, and informative project that is relevant to the current society and helpful for further research in updating future police funding and practices. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to perform an in-depth analysis on factors, like race, that were accounted for in thousands of fatal police shootings in recent years. With this research, we hope to learn the specific variables that contribute to racially biased fatalities and explore potential solutions to prevent them from occurring. \n",

    "### Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "The first direction we would like to go in for this project is to detect any notable differences between the distributions of races in the regional population and those who were victims of police shootings. After seeing that the proportion of Black Victims is higher than the proportion of the Blacks in our population, we decided to investigate the demographics of a particular region where a police killed a Black victim. We want to see if there is any indication in geography or demographics that may contribute to high Black fatalities in police shootings. Finally, we decided to look specifically at California, the state with the highest number of police killings, to see if its racial distribution can be related to geography. Since California has one of the highest relative Hispanic populations in the country, it would be interesting to see how the distribution of the minority population differs with the number of victims by race."

    "#### Data description\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data is an up to date log of police killings in the United States from the Washington Post for the past five years. It contains general notes about the event and even information about the victim, police and station. The information comes from several different news sources, social media posts and police reports. The data started being logged after the incident in 2014 where Michael Brown, an unarmed black man was killed by the police. A post investigation of this incident showed that the FBI severely undercounted the number of police-caused fatalities and the reason being many departments failed to require reports of this kind. The Washington Post’s database is kept up-to-date as fatal shootings and facts emerge from the Post's collective methods.\n",

    "The initial dataset, Washington Post's data of police fatal shooting incidents from Jan. 1, 2015, was recorded by culling local news reports, law enforcement websites, social media, as well as monitoring independent databases such Killed by Police and Fatal Encounters. The population of this data only includes all fatal shootings in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty and excludes deaths of people in custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers, or non-shooting deaths. The sampling frame consists of all entities in the population that were publicly reported in any form of way since Jan. 1, 2015. The sampling mechanism is a census which indicates that our sample consists of all entities in our sampling frame. The sample consists of 6280 observations of fatal police shootings from Jan 2, 2015 to May 9, 2021. Our data is administrative and has no scope of inference.\n",

    "Our final direction for this project was to look specifically at race and other regional demographics to see if it had a notable relationship with the number of killings by race in that area. To start, we created bar charts to represent the average proportions of total racial populations and total killings per county and state. With this, we would be able to see if there are any notable distinctions between the values of a certain race. After deciding to focus on the proportion of black victims in our dataset, we merged and melted the demographic data of the victims with the region data of the shooting locations. Then we created a heat map to visualize potential patterns of covariation between the variables of the combined dataset. We then performed a hypothesis test comparing the absolute differences between the racial distribution of the victims and the total population of each county. Since our focus was on the difference in the black population of victims and total, we decided to look at computing the absolute difference and the total variation distance test statistics. The absolute difference test statistics focused primarily on comparing the difference between the black proportion of those killed in police killings and the total populations in counties. The total variation distance measurement was used to calculate that same test statistic for all racial categories included in our data. To better understand racial killings in California, we grouped the killings by each race and calculated their proportions as well as aggregated the census data to obtain the racial demographics proportion for California. A grouped bar chart was created to compare the proportion of racial demographics represented in fatal shootings to the actual proportion of each race in California. We also created a horizontal bar chart displaying the 10 counties in California with highest total police killings with the racial distribution for each of the counties.\n"

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we analyzed the police shootings from the past 5 years by specifically looking at racial associations across space. Regionally, our Census data did not show anything remarkable about the various demographics with cases of Black Police Shooting victims. However, we think that there may be confounding variables that might contribute to high police shooting rates if we looked specifically at demographic information separately for each race. Perhaps if we were to explore the crime rates by race, we could see if there may be more potential opportunities for police shooting incidents to occur if a certain race had higher rates of  serious crimes. Also, exploring possible implicit bias within the police force that leads to racially motivated police brutality could explain the racial disparities in fatal police shootings. Since our data only includes the instances reported of fatal police shootings, our results do not show the true population of police brutality incidents in the United States. The racial disparities may be more exaggerated when taking into account all police brutality incidents.  In addition, since we were unable to effectively find census city data for each police shooting incident, we aggregated the demographics by county which may have underestimated or overestimated extremes within the region. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, we hope to have the resources to explore more about the racial disparities in police shootings in the United States. Instead of just focusing on the Black population we can look deeper into communities with larger minority populations and explore more about their grouped demographics. For example, if we can obtain city racial census data with demographic information such as income, we could explore more population differences that may act as confounding factors on police brutality. There are potentially more disparities in police shooting victims and we would like to further explore them. During our analysis, we noticed that police shooting victims were overwhelmingly male. Further research into the role of gender in being a victim of a police shooting could provide insight into more systematic bias in the police force or clues to other confounding variables to occurrences of police shootings.\n"
